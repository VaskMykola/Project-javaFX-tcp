# University-Project-javaFX-tcp

## Project Overview
This repository marks the initial phase of our university team project: a Class Scheduler application. The project was designed to demonstrate our proficiency in Java programming, focusing on JavaFX for GUI development and TCP/IP for network communication.

## Repository Contents
- `Client.java`: Implements a JavaFX-based graphical user interface for class management operations.
- `Server.java`: Contains the server-side logic for processing and storing class schedules.

## Project Evolution
1. Initial Development: This repository served as the starting point for our collaborative work on the Class Scheduler.
2. Repository Transfer: As the project progressed, development was moved to a team member's personal repository to streamline our workflow.
3. Continued Development: The team continued to enhance the application with additional features and improvements in the new repository.
4. Project Completion: The final version of the project was successfully completed and submitted for grading.

## Final Version
